* Nginx
- It is lightweight, high performance web server designed to deliver large amounts of static content with use of system resources

** Preserve a working configuration
- Make a copy of the server configuration file before making changes to it
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  cp /etc/nginx/nginx.config /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.backup
#+END_SRC

** Start, Stop, Reload
- After changing nginx.conf file, need to reload configuration before the change will take effect
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  service nginx reload
#+END_SRC

** Syntax
- *hash* # is using for comments
- Settings begin with the variable name and then state an argument/arguments separated by spaces
- All statements end with a semi-colon (;)
- Some settings have arguments that are themselves settings with arguments
  - All sub-directives are enclosed in one set of curly brackets (*{ }*)

** Defining directives
*** User
- Defines which Linux system user will own and run nginx server
*** worker_process
- Defines how many threads, or simultaneous instances, of nginx to run
*** pid
- Defines where nginx will write its master process ID
- Used by OS to keep track of and send signals to the nginx process

** HTTP (Universal Configuration)
#+BEGIN_SRC conf
  http {

      ##
      # Basic Settings
      ##

      sendfile on;
      tcp_nopush on;
      tcp_nodelay on;
      keepalive_timeout 65;
      types_hash_max_size 2048;
      # server_tokens off;

      # server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
      # server_name_in_redirect off;

      include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
      default_type application/octet-stream;

      ##
      # Logging Settings
      ##

      access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
      error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;

      ##
      # Gzip Settings
      ##

      gzip on;
      gzip_disable "msie6";
#+END_SRC

*** include
- It includes the file mine.types
  - Anything written in the file mine.types is interpreted as if it was written inside the http { } block

*** gzip
- It tells the server to use on-the-fly gzip compression to limit the amount of bandwidth used and speed up some transfers

** Server (Virtual Domains Configuration)
- HTTP block contains the statement `include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;`
- It allows for server block configurations to be loaded from files found in `site-enable` sub-directory
- Directives and settings that make up the server block/
  - File: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   #+BEGIN_SRC conf
     server {
             listen 80 default_server;
             listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;

             root /usr/share/nginx/html;
             index index.html index.htm;

             # Make site accessible from http://localhost/
             server_name localhost;

             location / {
                     # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                     # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                     try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
                     # Uncomment to enable naxsi on this location
                     # include /etc/nginx/naxsi.rules
             }
     }
   #+END_SRC
- Server block is where typical nginx user will make most of changes to default configuration
- Make separate file with its own server block for each virtual domain on your server

*** Listening Posts
- The listen directive, tells nginx the hostname/IP and TCP port where it should listen for HTTP connections

*** Name-Based Virtual Hosting
- server_name directive provide administrator name-based virtual hosting
- This allows multiple domains to be served from a single IP address
- Server decides which domain to serve based on the request header it receives
- Create one file per domain which want to host on server

** Access Logs
- It can be set in http block or in server block for specific virtual domain

** Location (File and Folder Configuration)
- The location setting lets you configure how nginx will respond to requests for resources within the server
- Example File: /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
  #+BEGIN_SRC conf
    location / { }
    location /images/ { }
    location /blog/ { }
    location /planet/ { }
    location /planet/blog/ { }
  #+END_SRC
